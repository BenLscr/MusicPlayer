# MusicPlayer
This app is a test. Made to train me.

MusicPlayer is a basic app with few possibilities. Read every tracks on the phone. User can play, pause, skip backward, skipforward. Only two views are available : a view with every track in a showed in a list and an expanded view with the current track read.

This app allowed me to check the import of drawables created from a design software. I first created the design of the application on Adobe XD.
I also wanted to try playing music, read data on storage.
